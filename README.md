<h2>Overview and Analysis</h2>

<p> Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with thousands of employees. As with any company, employees retire every year. As baby boomers are aging and looking toward retirement these numbers will continue to grow. PH would like to be proactive and start looking to the future, so they’ve enlisted Bobby, an HR Analyst.  Bobby has been tasked with figuring out who will be retiring and how many positions will be filled. This will help determine who will qualify for the retirement package HP will be offering. Six datasets have been provided with varying information. This information will be analyzed ensure HP continues with their success.

Below, you can see the breakdown of current titles for these employees, the bulk of the potential retirees fall within the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. You will also see a very small sample size of potential soon-to-be retirees.

If the bottom line needs to improve, then first contact the employees who have been there the longest and make the most money. This isn’t the easiest, but it can be effective.  If money isn’t a factor, start with the departments that would see the greatest impact. Hopefully, with enough planning there will be minimal impact to Pewlett-Hackard.
